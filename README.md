# Instagram UI Clone

This repository contains one of my first Flutter projects. I created this Instagram UI clone just as a starting project. Didn't knew about much stuff when I made this. But it turned up to be pretty good. There is not much of stuff here. Used static data in form of arrays to show pictures and posts. Implemented Stateful widgets at various instances.
